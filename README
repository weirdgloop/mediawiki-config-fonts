These three fonts are used by the EasyTimeline extension (ploticus).

At build time, they are copied into the Shellbox container that timelines
and ploticus are executed in.

This repository was formerly deployed as a submodule of
operations/mediawiki-config onto every appserver, but was removed after
the migration to Shellbox.
