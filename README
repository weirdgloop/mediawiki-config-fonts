I copied all these out of /usr/share/truetype/* from an Ubuntu app server.
This dir was used as the GDFONTPATH, possibly for ploticus for timelines,
but didn't exist. WTF?

... plus FreeSans.ttf which is what EasyTimeline hardcodes. :P

We can presumably dump it if we kill ploticus running from app servers.
